## How to compile?

### NOTE: Before you get started, just note that you can only build on Linux. The build is tested on the latest version of Ubuntu only

### Step 1:
#### Clone the repo using ``git clone https://github.com/ElectroBoy404NotFound/EVisualOS`` and cd into it using ``cd EVisualOS``
### Step 2:
#### Build the OS using ``make build``
### Step 3:
#### The kernel will now be build and an raw .img file will be present in EVisualOSKernel/bin and its name will be "EVisualOS.img". In the main folder run ``make run`` to run it and a qemu window should open with the os.
